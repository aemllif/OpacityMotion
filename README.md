# OpacityMotion
OpacityMotion is an iOS library that animates the opacity of UI elements based on the deviceâ€™s tilt. It supports any array of elements (text, images, or custom structures) and provides customizable minimum/maximum opacity values and sensitivity to device motion, allowing for smooth and dynamic visual effects.
